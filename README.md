# Responsive Design

#### What it is ðŸ¤™

This is an application that is currently in development to display some of the responsive design skills I have aquired. Along with the design, this site is responsible for adhearing to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

#### Tech

So far this application HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6). It will also contain Mocha/Chai and Jest for testing. 

#### Functionality

As of 4/22 this project allows for the switching of views on a single page, utilizing the hidden attribute in CSS. I have also built a carousel that can rotate through images. 
Upon completion, this application will have the ability to change color and styles of the webpage.
